        Dear PUBG MOBILE Players,<br>

        We have always strived to deliver a gaming environment that is fair and enjoyable for every player and prevent cheating. We take this issue very seriously; as such, each account in violation has received a 10-year ban. We would like to remind all players about the importance of fair play and thank you for keeping PUBG MOBILE fair and fun.<br>



        Cheaters Will Get Beat<br>

        We will continue to enforce stringent discipline against cheaters, and we want to thank you for helping us make PUBG MOBILE a better game. Going forward, to better ensure our game follows rules regarding personal privacy around the world and maintains the integrity of our users' personal information, we will randomly select a group banned cheaters and disclose information regarding their ranks, servers, and reasons for the ban:<br>
